Got it ✅ — thanks for clarifying. Based on your professor’s requirements, I’ll prepare a **professional `README.md`** that works both as developer documentation and as a high-level entry point for your project. It will include:

* **Overview** (what the program does, language, goals).
* **Project Structure** (folders and files with short descriptions).
* **How to Run / Compile** (setup, dependencies, usage examples).
* **Implementation Details** (crawler, detection modules, reporter).
* **Non-trivial Algorithms & Data Structures** (SQLi/XSS/CSRF detection strategies, payload markers, reporting structure).
* **Extensibility / Developer Guide** (how to add new modules).
* **Limitations & Future Work** (honest notes).

Here’s the complete `README.md` draft:

# Web Application Security Scanner

A modular Python-based scanner for detecting **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerabilities in **controlled environments** such as DVWA and TestPHP.  

This tool is designed for **educational and research purposes** — not for unauthorized penetration testing. Use only on systems where you have explicit permission.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Crawling**: Automatically discovers links and forms on a target site.  
- **SQL Injection detection**: Error-based, boolean-based, and optional time-based checks.  
- **XSS detection**: Reflection-based payload injection and HTML parsing.  
- **CSRF detection**: Checks for missing/weak CSRF tokens in forms.  
- **Reporting**: Saves results in both human-readable text and machine-readable JSON.  
- **Modularity**: Easy to extend with new vulnerability detection modules.

## ⚙️ Installation and Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- Dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `colorama`
  - `pytest`

### Setup
```bash
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-scanner.git
cd security-scanner

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Running the Scanner

```bash
# Run SQLi scan on TestPHP
python3 scanner.py --url "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1" --modules sqli -v

# Run XSS scan on DVWA (authenticated, example cookie)
python3 scanner.py --url "http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=test" \
    --cookies "PHPSESSID=<ID>; security=low" --modules xss

# Crawl first, then scan discovered URLs
python3 scanner.py --url "http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/" --crawl --outurls urls.txt
python3 scanner.py --input-urls urls.txt --modules sqli,xss,csrf
```

Reports will be saved in the `reports/` folder.

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

The scanner is modular and consists of:

1. **Crawler (`utils/crawler.py`)**

   * BFS crawler that discovers URLs and forms.
   * Collects parameters for testing.
   * Skips static resources (images, CSS, JS).

2. **HTTP Client (`utils/http_client.py`)**

   * Wraps `requests`.
   * Manages cookies, retries, headers.
   * Used consistently across modules.

3. **Payload Engine (`utils/payloads.py`)**

   * Provides reusable payloads for each vulnerability type.
   * Uses unique **marker strings** (e.g., `XSSMARKER_<id>`) to detect reflection.

4. **Detection Modules (`modules/`)**

   * **SQLi**: error-based (SQL error messages), boolean-based (response diff), optional time-based (sleep).
   * **XSS**: injects marker payloads and checks reflection in executable contexts.
   * **CSRF**: inspects forms for missing/weak CSRF tokens and tests enforcement.
   * All modules return findings as structured dictionaries.

5. **Reporter (`utils/reporter.py`)**

   * Aggregates findings across modules.
   * Outputs text and JSON reports.
   * Provides summary and detailed evidence.

## 🔍 Non-Trivial Algorithms and Data Structures

### SQL Injection Detection

* **Boolean-based differential testing**: Sends logically true vs false payloads and compares responses.
* **Error-based detection**: Searches for known SQL error messages (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
* **Time-based (optional)**: Uses delayed queries (`SLEEP(3)`) to confirm blind SQLi.

### XSS Detection

* **Marker-based reflection**: Injects `<script>XSSMARKER</script>` with unique IDs.
* **HTML parsing**: Uses BeautifulSoup to detect markers inside script tags, event handlers, or attributes.
* **Heuristic evidence collection**: Captures surrounding HTML context for reporting.

### CSRF Detection

* **Form analysis**: Extracts hidden fields, looks for common CSRF token names.
* **Enforcement testing**: Resubmits form without token and compares response codes.
* **Header verification**: Detects absence of Origin/Referer validation.

### Data Structures

* Findings are represented as dictionaries:

  ```python
  {
    "type": "SQL Injection",
    "location": "query",
    "url": "http://.../page.php?id=1",
    "param": "id",
    "payload": "' OR '1'='1",
    "evidence": "SQL syntax error message..."
  }
  ```
* Findings are aggregated into lists and reported in JSON/text.

## 👩‍💻 Developer Guide (Extending the Scanner)

Adding a new vulnerability module:

1. Create a new file in `modules/` (e.g., `modules/command_injection.py`).
2. Implement a class with a `scan(url)` method that:

   * Takes a URL or form as input.
   * Returns a list of findings (same dictionary structure as above).
3. Register the module in `scanner.py` under the CLI options.
4. Write unit tests under `tests/` to validate your module.
5. Run:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* **DOM-based XSS** not detected (requires JS execution in a browser).
* **False positives** possible on highly dynamic pages (changing lengths/content).
* **CSRF detection** may over-report if tokens are validated purely server-side in ways the scanner cannot detect.
* **Not a replacement for full-featured scanners** (e.g., ZAP, Burp Suite).

---

## 🚀 Future Work

* Add detection for Command Injection, File Upload vulnerabilities, Directory Traversal.
* Integrate a headless browser (Playwright/Puppeteer) for DOM XSS detection.
* Async scanning for better performance.
* Web dashboard for visualization.
* CI integration with JSON output.

✅ This README goes beyond a user manual — it provides the **developer-level documentation** your professor asked for:
- Describes architecture and non-trivial algorithms.  
- Explains design decisions not obvious from code.  
- Includes setup, running, extending, and limitations.  

Would you like me to also prepare a **short CONTRIBUTING.md** that explains coding style, testing strategy, and module conventions (for developers extending the project)?
