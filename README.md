## Architecture

### System Design

The scanner follows a modular plugin architecture where each vulnerability detector implements a standardized interface. The main components are:

1. **Main Controller** (`scanner.py`): Orchestrates the scanning process
2. **HTTP Client** (`extractor.py`): Manages web requests and sessions
3. **Crawler** (`crawler.py`): Discovers URLs and forms
4. **Detection Modules**: Specialized vulnerability scanners
5. **Reporter** (`reporter.py`): Generates scan reports

### Data Flow

```
URL Input → Crawler Discovery → Vulnerability Detection → Report Generation
     ↓            ↓                    ↓                      ↓
 HTTP Client → Form/URL Extraction → Payload Injection → Evidence Collection
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Each vulnerability detector implements a common `scan(url)` method
2. **Factory Pattern**: Scanner instances created based on module configuration
3. **Observer Pattern**: Findings collected and reported uniformly
4. **Template Method**: Common scanning workflow with specialized detection steps

## Core Algorithms

### SQL Injection Detection

The SQLi module employs a multi-phase detection approach:

#### Phase 1: Basic Payload Injection
```python
# Error-based detection
BASIC_PAYLOADS = [
    "' OR '1'='1",
    "' OR 1=1 -- ",
    "1' OR '1'='1' -- ",
    # ... 7 total basic payloads
]

# Error pattern matching
SQL_ERRORS = [
    "SQL syntax", "mysql_fetch", "ORA-", "PostgreSQL query failed",
    # ... 13 total error patterns
]
```

#### Phase 2: Boolean-Based Confirmation
The scanner uses differential analysis:
- Send `1' AND '1'='1` (true condition)
- Send `1' AND '1'='2` (false condition)
- Compare responses for differences in status codes, length, or content

#### Phase 3: Time-Based Detection
```python
TIME_PAYLOADS = [
    "' OR SLEEP(3)-- ",
    "'; SELECT SLEEP(3); -- ",
    "'; SELECT pg_sleep(3); -- "
]
```
Measures response time deltas to detect blind SQL injection.

### XSS Detection

#### Unique Marker System
Each XSS test uses a unique marker to avoid false positives:
```python
marker = f"XSSMARKER_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
payload_with_marker = payload.replace("XSSMARKER", marker)
```

#### Context-Aware Detection
The scanner analyzes response context to determine exploitability:

1. **Script Context**: Marker inside `<script>` tags
2. **Attribute Context**: Marker in event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`)
3. **HTML Context**: Marker parsed as new HTML elements
4. **JSON Context**: Marker reflected in JSON responses

#### Payload Variety
```python
self.payloads = [
    "XSSMARKER",  # Basic reflection test
    "<script>XSSMARKER</script>",  # Script tag injection
    "<img src=x onerror=XSSMARKER>",  # Image with error handler
    "\"> <svg/onload=XSSMARKER>",  # SVG injection
    # ... 8 total payload variations
]
```

### CSRF Detection

#### Token Recognition
```python
TOKEN_KEYWORDS = [
    "csrf", "token", "authenticity_token", "xsrf", 
    "_token", "_xsrf", "nonce", "anticsrf",
    "__requestverificationtoken"
]
```

#### Enforcement Testing
For POST forms with candidate tokens:
1. Submit form WITH tokens (baseline)
2. Submit form WITHOUT tokens (test case)
3. Compare responses for protection enforcement

### Crawling Algorithm

The crawler uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) with domain confinement:

```python
def crawl(self, start_url):
    parsed_start = urlparse(start_url)
    base_domain = parsed_start.netloc
    to_visit = [start_url]
    seen = set()
    
    while to_visit and len(seen) < self.max_pages:
        url = to_visit.pop(0)
        if url in seen:
            continue
        # Process URL and discover links...
```

## Module Documentation

### HTTP Client (`extractor.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages all HTTP communications with retry logic and session persistence.

**Key Features**:
- Cookie parsing and management
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Connection timeout handling
- Session persistence across requests

**Non-Trivial Implementation Details**:
- Custom cookie parser handles malformed cookie strings
- Retry logic with exponential backoff: `sleep_time = backoff_factor ** attempt`
- Session preservation across multiple scanner modules

### Crawler (`crawler.py`)

**Purpose**: Discovers URLs and forms within the same domain.

**Key Features**:
- BFS-based URL discovery
- Form extraction with method and action resolution
- Configurable page limits and request delays
- Same-domain link filtering

**Algorithm Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is vertices (pages) and E is edges (links)

### SQL Injection Scanner (`sql_injection.py`)

**Purpose**: Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities using multiple techniques.

**Detection Methods**:
1. **Error-based**: Pattern matching on database error messages
2. **Boolean-based**: Differential analysis of true/false conditions
3. **Time-based**: Response timing analysis for blind SQLi

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Three-phase confirmation reduces false positives
- Payload encoding preserves original parameter structure
- Baseline response comparison for length-based detection

### XSS Scanner (`checks_xss.py`)

**Purpose**: Identifies Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities with context analysis.

**Detection Contexts**:
- Script tag content
- HTML attribute values (especially event handlers)
- New HTML element creation
- JSON response reflection

**Non-Trivial Features**:
- UUID-based markers prevent false positives from cached responses
- BeautifulSoup parsing distinguishes between executed and escaped content
- Multi-context payload testing increases detection coverage

### CSRF Scanner (`checks_csrf.py`)

**Purpose**: Detects missing Cross-Site Request Forgery protections.

**Detection Strategy**:
1. Form discovery and analysis
2. CSRF token field identification
3. Protection enforcement testing (POST forms only)
4. Token keyword pattern matching

**Implementation Notes**:
- Only tests POST forms for enforcement (GET forms can't reliably confirm protection)
- Uses response comparison (status codes and content length) to detect enforcement
- Conservative approach to avoid false negatives

### Reporter (`reporter.py`)

**Purpose**: Generates comprehensive security reports.

**Features**:
- Evidence sanitization for safe display
- Timestamped report files
- Vulnerability categorization and counting
- Structured output format

## Extending the Scanner

### Creating New Vulnerability Detectors

1. **Implement the Scanner Interface**:
```python
class NewVulnerabilityScanner:
    def __init__(self, logger=None, http=None, delay_between_requests=0.5):
        self.logger = logger if logger is not None else Logger(verbosity=0)
        self.http = http
        self.delay = delay_between_requests

    def scan(self, url: str):
        findings = []
        # Implementation here
        return findings
```

2. **Register the Module**:
Add to the scanners dictionary in `scanner.py`:
```python
scanners = {
    "sqli": lambda: SQLInjectionScanner(logger, http, delay_between_requests=args.delay),
    "xss": lambda: XSSScanner(logger, http, delay_between_requests=args.delay),
    "csrf": lambda: CSRFScanner(logger, http, delay_between_requests=args.delay),
    "new_module": lambda: NewVulnerabilityScanner(logger, http, delay_between_requests=args.delay)
}
```

3. **Finding Structure**:
All findings must use this format:
```python
{
    "type": "Vulnerability Type",
    "location": "query|form", 
    "url": "http://example.com/vulnerable",
    "method": "GET|POST",
    "param": "parameter_name",
    "payload": "test_payload",
    "evidence": "proof_of_vulnerability"
}
```

### Adding New Payloads

**SQL Injection**:
Add to `BASIC_PAYLOADS` or `TIME_PAYLOADS` in `sql_injection.py`

**XSS**:
Add to `self.payloads` in `checks_xss.py.__init__()`

**CSRF**:
Add token patterns to `TOKEN_KEYWORDS` in `checks_csrf.py`

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Test Structure
- Mock HTTP client simulates web server responses
- Unit tests for each detection algorithm
- Integration tests for full scanning workflow
- False positive/negative validation tests

### Test Coverage
- SQLi: Error-based, boolean-based, and time-based detection
- XSS: Multiple context and payload variations
- CSRF: Token detection and enforcement testing
- Crawler: URL discovery and form extraction

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Document non-obvious algorithms with comments
- Maintain consistent logging levels

### Logging Standards
- `logger.info()`: General progress information
- `logger.debug()`: Detailed technical information
- `logger.warn()`: Non-critical issues
- `logger.error()`: Errors that affect functionality

### Error Handling
- Catch specific exceptions rather than bare except
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Continue scanning when possible after non-fatal errors

### Performance Considerations
- Use configurable delays between requests
- Implement early termination when vulnerability confirmed
- Cache baseline responses for comparison
- Limit crawler page discovery to prevent infinite loops

### Security Considerations
- Never scan production systems without explicit permission
- Include clear warnings about ethical usage
- Implement rate limiting to avoid service disruption
- Sanitize all evidence in reports to prevent accidental execution
